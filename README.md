# DSA with JavaScript

This repository contains my notes and practice problems for learning Data Structures and Algorithms using JavaScript. I am focusing on building a strong foundation by understanding concepts clearly and solving beginner-friendly questions step by step.

## What I'm Learning
Arrays  
Hashing  
Two Pointers  
Sliding Window  
Binary Search  
Sorting  
Recursion  
Linked Lists (coming soon)

## How I Practice
Understand the concept  
Write the solution in simple JavaScript  
Add comments to explain logic  
Improve the approach slowly  

## Structure
arrays folder – array problems  
hashing folder – frequency and map problems  
two_pointers folder – two pointer problems  
practice folder – mixed questions  

## Goal
Solve 100 easy DSA questions and build strong basics.
