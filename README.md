DSA with JavaScript

This repository contains my notes and practice problems for learning Data Structures and Algorithms using JavaScript.
I am focusing on building a strong foundation by understanding concepts clearly and solving easy-to-medium questions step by step.

What I’m Learning

Arrays
Hashing
Two Pointers
Sliding Window
Binary Search
Basic Sorting
Recursion
Basic Linked Lists (coming soon)

How I Practice

Understand the concept
Write the solution in simple JavaScript
Add comments to explain each step
Try multiple approaches when possible
Improve code after understanding the logic

File Structure

arrays folder – problems related to arrays
hashing folder – hashing and frequency problems
two_pointers folder – two-pointer technique problems
practice folder – mixed easy questions

Goals

Solve 100 easy array questions
Build confidence in problem solving
Write clean and readable JavaScript code
Slowly move to medium difficulty questions

Notes

This repo is mainly for learning and tracking progress.
Code is written in the simplest style possible for clear understanding.
